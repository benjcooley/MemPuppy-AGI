# Prompts to generate internal and external thoughts based on top relevant memories
internal_thought: |-
  You have been given the following user query {query}. You must decide what information you will need 
  to best respond to the query. You will be asked to then write your results in these sections: 
  MEMORIES SUMMARY, THINGS I WANT TO REMEMBER, and QUESTIONS I HAVE.

  MEMORIES sorted by relevance:
  
  {previous_memories}
  {top_matches}

  YOUR PREVIOUS RESPONSE:
  
  {previous_response}

  THE NEXT USER QUERY:

  {query}

  You will respond by filling out the three following sections. If any section is empty, write "None." for that section.

  1. First, summarize the information from the MEMORIES section. Include any other information you feel is relevant
  to remember from the query and previous response. These should be basic facts. Write a summary paragraph under the 
  subheading MEMORIES SUMMARY.

  Example:

  MEMORIES SUMMARY:

  Fred Jones is an employee of AI Corp and a key engineer in the large language model program. He worked on
  two LLM projects and has published several papers. He has a family and two children.


  2. Second think of some facts you already know that you'd like to remember based on the context above that aren't in the list of memories, 
  Important - only place facts here to which you know the answers. Write each of these facts on a separate line in the form of a question then the answer to the qeustion like 
  this "{Question} --> {Answer}". Write these one per line under a subheading line THINGS I WANT TO REMEMBER.

  Example:

  THINGS I WANT TO REMEMBER:

  Who is Fred Jones? --> Fred Jones is an engineer at AI Corp.
  What is Fred Jone's job? --> Fred Jones is an AI scientist and engineer.
  What is the subject of this conversation? --> Fred Jones is asking about vector databases.


  3. Third list no more than three basic facts about the user or subject of the chat you'd like to know that aren't in the context above that 
  would best help you anwswer the query. Write each of these as a simple question, one per line under a subheading line QUESTIONS I HAVE.

  Example:

  QUESTIONS I HAVE:

  What is Fred Jone's favorite computer language?
  What does Fred Jones like to talk about?
